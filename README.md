# ePaper Calendar

Playing around with my new waveshare 7in3g e-paper screen, going to try and render a calendar

# WARNING

There's something a bit screwy around "burn in" I've read both that it occurs and also that it doesn't occur.  Try to avoid leaving the screen with stuff on it for more than a day, if you want it always on, do the clear thing at least daily so it jiggles all those pixels around.
